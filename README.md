# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

 Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Work That Was Done By Me.
I created function "function generatorPassword()"
Then Prompted user to choose the length of a password. Once that was done, user has to choose what symbols, numbers or letters are going to be in the choosen password. After all prompts are made. User will be provided with a secure password.

I love to complain and would like to say that this challenge was the hardest out of 3 we've completed.
